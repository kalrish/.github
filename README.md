# Common GitHub workflows

This repository hosts [GitHub actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions) and [GitHub workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows) that automate my [workflows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) in projects at GitHub.
It is inspired by [GitHub's starter workflows](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows).
